This website is made entirely with Arctic!
You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/arctic-framework-org/).
You can find the source code for this specific demos page [here](https://github.com/RyanBrewer317/arctic-framework-org/blob/main/src/demos.gleam).

 [ryanbrewer.dev](https://ryanbrewer.dev) is another website built with Arctic,

As I write this right now, though, it isn't using the latest version, so is a little slower.
